Create a new git repository for your project (if you don't have one already) and setup the openFrame repo as a remote.

    $ git remote add openFrame git://github.com/PabloEskimo/openFrame.git
    $ git pull openFrame master
    $ git push

You can then merge in any future changes to the openFrame framework within your project at a later date by doing:

    $ git pull openFrame master
